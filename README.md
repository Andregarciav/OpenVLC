# OpenVLC 

This is the repository for the OpenVLC platform, an open-source, flexible and low-cost Visible Light Communication System platform. Research and development are conducted at IMDEA Networks Institute.

## New OpenVLC1.3 version

We are delighted to announce that OpenVLC1.3 is ready for delivery! OpenVLC1.3 can now achieve a throughput of 400 Kb/s at the Transport Layer at a distance of more than 3 meter, powered simply by the BeagleBone Black!

You can now contact us for details if you have interests in trying them!  Details are at http://www.openvlc.org/get-started.html

## What is Visible Light Communication - LiFi? 

Visible Light Communication (VLC), sometimes also referred to as â€œLiFi", uses standard off-the-shelf visible light LEDs to transmit data using the visible light spectrum. VLC is receiving strong attention from the designers of the 5G networks and beyond. VLC can enable new pervasive wireless systems in the context of the Internet of Things.

## Our Mission. 

The lack of an open-source and low-cost reference platform is hindering the progresses of research and industry in VLC systems. A general-purpose platform would add momentum to VLC and would open up new avenues of VLC research and spark the interest of researchers and engineers.  We take an initial step toward this and we design OpenVLC, an open-source Visible Light Communication platform for fast prototyping of new system protocols to build a LiFi network. It runs on a cost-effective yet powerful credit-card-sized embedded board.Type your paragraph here.
